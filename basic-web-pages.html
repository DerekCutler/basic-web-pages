    <h1>Matchy matchy</h1>
    <p>1st, let's learn some basic html.</p>

    <h2>headings2</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is an unordered List:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
        <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
        <li>
            <p>They don't need to be in any particular order</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
        <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
            an ordered list</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Inline Elements:</h2>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

    <p>Other times you n<em>eed to <strong>stro</em>ng</strong>ly emphasize tthe importance of a word or phrase.</p>

    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
